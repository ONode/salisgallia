# 10 Minute Dynamic Mobile App

This demo will show how to create a dynamic mobile application in 10 minutes <sup>give or take, more or less ;)</sup>

## How to do this?

* [Create a REST API with some content](API.md)
* [Create a Mobile APP with some dynamic screens](APP.md)
* [Create a SDK to connect API and APP](SDK.md)

## Requirements

### The commands `node` and `npm` need to be working on your system.

Refer to [your friend](https://google.com/) on how to do this for your platform.

### Nodemon

We will use nodemon to automatically restart the server when we change our code:

    $ npm install -g nodemon
